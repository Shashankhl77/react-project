Component Structure and State Management Choices

1. Component Overview
   Counter Component

   - The Counter component is a functional React component utilizing the useState hook for managing count state.
   - It uses useSpring from react-spring to animate the background color dynamically based on the counter value.
   - The component consists of three primary buttons: Increment, Decrement, and Reset.
   - MUI components like Button and Container are used for layout and styling.
     Dashboard Component
   - The Dashboard component fetches and displays user data from localStorage.
   - Uses useState and useEffect hooks to manage and retrieve the user list.
   - The data is presented in a table and a bar chart (using recharts), showing users grouped by email domain.
   - It also includes a total user count displayed in an MUI Paper component.
   - Implements a useMemo hook to optimize domain-based user count calculations, preventing unnecessary re-computation.
     UserForm Component
   - A form-based component for user input and management.
   - Uses useState to handle form inputs and store users.
   - Retrieves and persists data using localStorage.
   - Implements a function to generate a unique user ID dynamically.
   - Includes form validation to prevent empty user submissions.

2. State Management Choices
   State Hooks (useState)

   - Used in all components to manage local component-level state.
   - Counter manages a numeric state (count).
   - Dashboard and UserForm maintain an array of user objects.
     Effects (useEffect)
   - Dashboard and UserForm use useEffect to load user data from localStorage when the component mounts.
     Local Storage for Persistence
   - Dashboard and UserForm utilize localStorage to store and retrieve user data across sessions.
     React-Spring for Animation
   - The Counter component employs useSpring to animate the background color based on the count value dynamically.
     MUI for UI Components
   - All components use Material-UI (MUI) for consistent and responsive styling.
   - Container, Button, Typography, and Table are key UI elements.
     Recharts for Data Visualization
   - The Dashboard component integrates recharts to display user email domain distribution in a bar chart.

3. Potential Enhancements
   - Extract shared logic (such as localStorage interactions) into reusable hooks or utility functions.
   - Implement global state management (like Redux or Context API) if data sharing between components increases.
   - Add validation and error handling in UserForm for better user experience.
   - Optimize performance by memoizing computed values (e.g., domainCounts in Dashboard).
   - Implement a centralized theme provider using MUI's ThemeProvider for consistent styling.
